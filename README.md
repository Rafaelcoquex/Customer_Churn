# Customer_Churn
Customer Churn refers to a decision made by the customer about the end of the business relationship. It also refers to the loss of customers. 
Customer loyalty and customer turnover always add up to 100%. If a company has a 60% loyalty rate, then the customer loss rate is 40%. According to the 80/20 customer profitability rule, 20% of customers are generating 80% of revenue. 
Therefore, it is very important to predict the users who are likely to leave the business relationship and the factors that affect the customer's decisions.
In this project, it was predict Customer Churn in a Telecom.
